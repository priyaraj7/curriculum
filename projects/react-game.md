# Project - React Game

### Introduction

You've now learned enough React to create a game!. This project is to practice fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.

### General guidelines for projects:

You are welcome to rewrite the game you made last week in React or to make a different one. Here are some [examples](https://bg.reactjs.org/community/examples.html). Please do not select hangman because of its racist origins.

I would recommend starting your app in codeSandbox, codePen, replit.com, etc. Then toward the end of the week when we learn how to build React apps locally copy your files to your local drive.

By Friday afternoon (pair programming time) make sure you have your game [hosted on GitHub Pages](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-host-your-react-app-on-github-pages-for-free-919ad201a4cb) and your PR ready to go for your partner.

### Additional requirements:

- Have some sort of input that you receive from one component that you pass to another (such as number of tries, hi/low number, etc.)

- Have some sort of counter that uses the useState hook to update the score or count to the screen

### Frequently Asked Questions

- We can add common FAQs here. Open a PR if you have any questions.
